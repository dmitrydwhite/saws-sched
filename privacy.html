  <h2>Privacy Policy and Data Sharing</h2>
  <div id="scheduler">
    <p>
      The Silverton Area Warming Shelter Scheduler uses third-party software, specifically Facebook and Google, do uniquely identify and log in its users.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not use your account data for any other purpose than logging you in as an individual user; your Facebook or Google account data will not be shared by us for any reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only use we have for your third-party account information is to uniquely identify you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Silverton Area Warming Shelter Scheduler requires you to provide a phone number that can receive SMS messages, in order for the app to function as designed.  If you do not have a phone number attached to your Facebook or Google account, we will request that you provide one.  This phone number will be for internal use by the Silverton Area Warming Shelter only; it will not be associated with the third-party account that you use to log in for any other apps or software.
    </p>
    <p>
      By providing a phone number that can receive SMS messages, you are agreeing to receive SMS messages at that phone number for the purpose and intent of coordinating volunteer activities for the Silverton Area Warming Shelter.  These reminder SMS messages will be sent by an automated system programmed to send you one SMS message during the evening before your scheduled shift, or two evenings before if you are scheduled to bring breakfast.  The SMS reminder messages will contain the shift or task you are scheduled for and the date.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you experience problems with the automated SMS system (such as failure to receive reminder SMS messages or receipt of too many reminder SMS messages) contact an administrator or coordinator with the Silverton Area Warming Shelter immediately so the situation can be resolved.
